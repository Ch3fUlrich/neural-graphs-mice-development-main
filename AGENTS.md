# MCP Server Stack — AGENTS.md

This repository is configured with a self-hosted MCP server stack for AI coding
agents. Three servers are active:

| Server | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Serena** | LSP-powered semantic code navigation and refactoring (memory/config tools filtered out) |
| **Superpowers** | Disciplined workflow skills (TDD, debugging, planning, brainstorming) |
| **Mem0** | Unified persistent cross-session memory (uses stdio transport for robustness) |

> **IMPORTANT: Project Isolation for Mem0**
> To prevent cross-project memory spillover, you **MUST** always specify the project's folder name as the `user_id` when calling any Mem0 tools (e.g. `user_id="MaxEnt"`, `user_id="SERBRA"`, etc.).

---

## First-Time Setup (Per Repository)

When starting in a new repository, Serena automatically activates and indexes the workspace via the client's `--project-from-cwd` flag. No manual project creation or activation is required.

To verify Serena and Mem0 connection:
```
# Verify Serena code navigation
mcp_serena_find_symbol(name_path_pattern="main")

# Verify Mem0 connection
mcp_mem0_get_memories(user_id="<current-repo-folder-name>")
```
If these return results, the stack is ready.

## Serena Tools — Semantic Code Navigation

Use these **instead of reading entire files**. They return precise results with 10-100× fewer tokens.

### Finding and Understanding Code

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mcp_serena_find_symbol` | Search for functions, classes, variables by name across the codebase |
| `mcp_serena_get_symbols_overview` | Get a structured outline of a file (all top-level symbols) |
| `mcp_serena_find_referencing_symbols` | Find every call site / usage of a symbol |
| `mcp_serena_find_declaration` | Jump to where a symbol is defined |
| `mcp_serena_find_implementations` | Find all implementations of an interface/abstract method |
| `mcp_serena_get_diagnostics_for_file` | Get IDE-level errors/warnings for a file |

**Pro tip**: Use `find_symbol` with `depth=1` to see a class's methods without reading the body. Use `include_body=True` only when you need the actual implementation.

### Editing and Refactoring

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mcp_serena_rename_symbol` | Rename a symbol across the entire codebase (LSP-safe) |
| `mcp_serena_replace_symbol_body` | Replace a function/method/class definition |
| `mcp_serena_insert_after_symbol` | Add new code after a symbol (e.g., new method at end of class) |
| `mcp_serena_insert_before_symbol` | Add new code before a symbol |
| `mcp_serena_safe_delete_symbol` | Delete a symbol only if it has no remaining references |

---

## Mem0 Tools — Unified Persistent Memory

Mem0 is the single source of truth for persistent repository and user memory.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mcp_mem0_add_memory` | Store a fact, pattern, or decision about the project |
| `mcp_mem0_get_memories` | List all stored memories for this project |
| `mcp_mem0_search_memories` | Retrieve stored memories by semantic search query |
| `mcp_mem0_delete_memory` | Remove a memory by its ID |

**Use memories for**: architecture decisions, build commands, test patterns, user preferences, known pitfalls. Memories persist across sessions and agents.

---

## Superpowers Tools — Disciplined Workflows

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mcp_superpowers_use_skill` | Activate a workflow by name |
| `mcp_superpowers_list_skills` | List all available skills |
| `mcp_superpowers_recommend_skills` | Get skill recommendations for a task |

Available skills: `brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`,
`writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`,
`requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review`, `finishing-a-development-branch`,
`dispatching-parallel-agents`, `verification-before-completion`, `using-git-worktrees`.

**Rule**: For multi-step tasks, activate the relevant workflow first instead of improvising.

## Best Practices

1. **Read less code** — Use Serena's `find_symbol` and `get_symbols_overview` instead of reading entire files with `read_file`.
2. **Store what you learn** — Every significant discovery goes into `mcp_mem0_add_memory` (always specify the project name as `user_id`).
3. **Use workflows** — Complex tasks benefit from structured approaches via Superpowers.
4. **Verify with evidence** — Tool results are ground truth; verify before acting.
